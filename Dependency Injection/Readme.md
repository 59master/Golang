Why use a dependency injection?
- **Loose coupling implementation**
  DI reduces the dependencies between classes, making them less reliant on specific implementations. This allows for easier modification and replacement of dependencies without affecting other parts of the code
- **Testability**
  By allowing you to easily substitute dependencies with mock or stub implementations during testing, DI makes it easier to isolate and test individual units of code
- **Maintainability**
  A modular design, promoted by DI, makes the codebase easier to understand, modify, and extend, as changes to dependencies become isolate
- **Increased Flexibility**
  DI allows for dynamic dependencies configuration, making applications more adaptable to different environments or use cases
